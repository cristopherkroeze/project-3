later on, add isAdmin check in the authMiddleware which overrides all middleware and allows the admin to edit anything and delete anything

in animes.js routes ask about the chained.populate and why it only works with one populate, not multiple

0. work on "add animes" component and make it functional
    -add a selector for main character/voice actor (not a required field)
1. work on "add character" component
    -add a selector for voice actor/anime (not required field)
2. work on "add voice actor" component
    -add a checklist for animes theyve been in

OPTIONAL: make it so that when someone creates an anime it immediately navigates them to the create character field, then adds that character to the anime, and navigates them to the create voice actor page and that voice actor is added to the anime/main character
    -make both the character creation step and voice actor creation step optional with a "skip" button

2. change the code in the pages from projects to animes and populate them
with the components even though the components are currently empty
3. fill out the "card" components
4. Create Components
[use this https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/cards/
to create the components (character card voice actor card,etc)]

1. populate pages with basic things
    d. allAnimesPage
    e. animeDetailsPage
    f. editAnimePage
    g. characterPage
    h. voiceActorDetailsPage
    i. allVoiceActorsPage
