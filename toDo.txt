toDo:

add isAdmin check in the authMiddleware which overrides all middleware and allows the admin to edit anything and delete anything

QUESTIONS/HELP FOR MONDAY:

HIGH PRIORITY:
1. My "edit user" works; however, the img and name do not update until after you log out and back in
    -"Genre" doesn't seem to store its value and always resets to Action in the selector

2. When I add a comment, it doesn't show up unless I refresh (right now i used window.location.reload(false); as a workaround)
    -same with deleting

3. For some reason the "added by" field continued to be empty even though I'm adding comments the same way im adding animes
    -in the database, the added by field is not empty

4. For some reason, favoriteAnimes is not populating on my user profile page (maybe because User itself isnt populated anywhere? I don't have a get route for user which would get the latest user)
    -the profile page does not reflect your favorite animes in the database

5. when navigating back to /animes after rating, the new rating is not shown until the user refreshes or hits the "animes" button at the top of the page
    -I could use window.location.reload(false); as a workaround?
6. remove from favorites works but doesnt redirect to the profile page and the user is only updated upon logout and login
    -refreshing the page seems to work

LOW PRIORITY:
1. my background picture on my homepage doesnt repeat even when i say repeat:true, so when you scroll down its just white
2. the background color of some of my pages doesnt become black when i change it in the CSS or inline style it


Chunk 1:
1. RIP the cloudinary code from project 2 and add it to the "edit" and "create" components
2. copy the cloudinary code from project 2 so that your img can be uploaded from your computer (this will affect user, anime, and character routes)
    -add cloudinary secret/url/etc to .env
3. re-test create and edit functionality
4.color the backgrounds black/make the background images flush?
