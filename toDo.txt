add isAdmin check in the authMiddleware which overrides all middleware and allows the admin to edit anything and delete anything

QUESTIONS/HELP FOR MONDAY:

HIGH PRIORITY:

1. Add to Favorites and Remove from favorites work; however, the user does not update unless you refresh
2. Cloudinary

LOW PRIORITY:
1. my background picture on my homepage doesnt repeat even when i say repeat:true, so when you scroll down its just white
2. the background color of some of my pages doesnt become black when i change it in the CSS or inline style it


Chunk 1:
1. RIP the cloudinary code from project 2 and add it to the "edit" and "create" components
2. copy the cloudinary code from project 2 so that your img can be uploaded from your computer (this will affect user, anime, and character routes)
    -add cloudinary secret/url/etc to .env
3. re-test create and edit functionality
4.color the backgrounds black/make the background images flush?
